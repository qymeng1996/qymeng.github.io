I am a PhD candidate and will graduate in June 2025. My major is Crop genetics and Breeding from [College of Plant Science & Technology](https://cpst.hzau.edu.cn/) of [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Genome assembly and annotation, Comparative Genomic, Population genetics, Epigenomic analysis and Transcriptome.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuan Daojun](https://faculty.hzau.edu.cn/ydj/zh_CN/skxx/91170/list/index.htm) of [Group of Cotton Genetic improvement](https://cotton.hzau.edu.cn/).
